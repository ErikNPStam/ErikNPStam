# 👋 Hi, I’m @ErikNPStam  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software engineering student exploring the vast world of technology and code.  

## 👀 I’m interested in:  
- Building robust and efficient software solutions.  
- **Cybersecurity**: Understanding vulnerabilities, securing systems, and ensuring robust defenses.  
- Learning and experimenting with new technologies and frameworks.  
- Exploring the fascinating intersection of **development** and **operations** as I work toward a career in **DevOps**.  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- **C# and .NET**: Building applications using the .NET framework and deepening my understanding of C#.  
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Strengthening my knowledge in Node.js and modern web development practices.  
- DevOps fundamentals, including CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud technologies.  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
- Open-source projects in **C#**, **.NET**, **Node.js**, or **DevOps tooling**.  
- Security-focused projects aimed at improving software resilience and defense mechanisms.  
- Projects that promote best practices in software engineering and operational excellence.  

## 📫 How to reach me:  
- **GitHub:** [@ErikNPStam](https://github.com/ErikNPStam)   

## ⚡ Fun fact:  
When I'm not coding or learning about DevOps and cybersecurity, you'll often find me exploring tech blogs, tinkering with side projects, or enjoying a good game!
